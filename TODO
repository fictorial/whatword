settimeout is throttled... need to perhaps to note visibilitychange (leave) vs
return and if the delta is too big, simply reload the page

The `#settings` seems to stick to the URL... that shouldn't happen.

Need a flash or something when the game starts.. Get Ready is not enough.

disable DEBUG in backend config

if you are the only player and get the word, restart faster...

make the status text be a bubble off the floating emoji?

getLocalGuessLetterElement throwing error if you get the word on the last guess (5 vs 6 somewhere)
