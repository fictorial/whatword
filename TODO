## production deployment?

- fly.io?
  - load balancer: can handle 1000 clients easily... up limits
  - custom domain: cname or A records? google. how does that work with multiple regions?
  - where do I set the secret for SECRET?
  - where do I set NODE_ENV to production?

- cloudflare
  - not sure how to just launch a node.js app there

- deno deploy
  - rewrite in typescript which is probably not that hard

- digital ocean vps?
    - would like this just to work in various regions (fly)
